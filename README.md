### Assignment: Tip Calculator

You are working as a developer for a restaurant app, and you need to create a function that calculates the tip amount based on the total bill and the desired tip percentage. Follow the steps below:

1. Define a function named calculateTip that takes two parameters: billAmount (a number representing the total bill) and tipPercentage (a number representing the desired tip percentage).
2. Inside the function, calculate the tip amount by multiplying the billAmount by the tipPercentage (converted to a decimal value).
3. Return the calculated tip amount from the function.
4. Call the calculateTip function with different values for billAmount and tipPercentage, and log the results to the console.

Expected Output:

Tip for a $50 bill with 15% tip: 7.5
Tip for a $75 bill with 20% tip: 15
Tip for a $100 bill with 18% tip: 18
